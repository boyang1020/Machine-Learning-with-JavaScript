# ML Kits

Starter projects for learning about Machine Learning.
# Machine-Learning-with-JavaScript

1. Problem Solving Process
2. Identify data that is relevant to the problem
3. Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve
4. Decide on the type of output you are predicting 
5. Based on type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine acorrelation between your 'feature' and 'label'
6. Use model fenerated by algoritm to make a prediction

Two differnt types of outputs used in this project
1. Classification: the value of our labels belong to a discrete set
2. Regression: the value of our labels belong to a continuous set

What's the fastest way to learn machine learning?
1. Master the fundmental operations around working with data.
2. Strong knowledge of data handling basics makes applying any algorithm trivial.

Pros and cons of linear regression
1. Fast! Only train one time, then use for any prediction.
2. Uses methods that will be very important in more complicated ML.
3. Harder to understand intuitively.
